# Python_Install
This is a PowerShell scrip that:
* installs Python on a windows computer, without the need of administrator rights
* installs (or updates) a chosen list of libraries via pip

Usage:
* download the script
* open the program PowerShell ISE on your laptop
* copy/paste the content of the script in PowerShell
* you can change the parameters at the beginning of the script. The parameters are pretty self explanatory. For example you can:
  * choose not to install python if you only wish to install new libraries
  * specify that you are behind a proxy
  * ...
* execute the script
* confirm the installation of Python, without changing the default parameters
